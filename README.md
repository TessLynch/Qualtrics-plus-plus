# Qualtrics++: Hulkifying Qualtrics

Qualtrics is no doubt the king of online survey platform at least as far as academics are concerned. However, creating a working Qualtrics survey that involves moderately complicated logics is downright painful.

To alleviate the pain, I wrote `Qualtrcis++`, a Javascript library that sits on top of Qualtrics engine to strong-arm Qualtrics into a research-friendly tool.

To use Qualtrics++ could not be easier. Click on this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lilchow/Qualtrics-plus-plus/master/headfile.html) and copy all the text that appears in your browser. Then go to the **Look & Feel** setting of your Qualtrics survey and directly paste all the text you just copied into the *Header* box as shown in the picture below. Save the changes and _presto_! Stay tuned for the upcoming Qualtrics++ manual.

A more polished documentation will be up soon. But for now, please refer to this [powerpoint file](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3493773/Qualtrics%2B%2B.pptx) if you want to give it a spin. Please refer to the links below for more useful resources on how to conduct psych experiments in Qualtrics.
